            <p className="font-SairaCondensed">The year is 2031. A revolutionary discovery has ignited a global scrambleâ€”an exceptionally rare resource with nearly limitless energy potential. While the resource itself is finite, its power promises to reshape the world. Governments and private organizations alike are vying for control, and what began as covert operations has erupted into full-scale conflict across the Pacific.</p>
            <p className="font-SairaCondensed">You are a pilot in Task Force "Ascend", the elite unit of Aspis, a private military contractor hired by a powerful corporation to secure one of the largest deposits hidden deep within an uncharted island chain in the southern Pacific. Your mission, codenamed "Skyfall", begins as a straightforward operation to dominate the skies and claim the resource.</p>
            <p className="font-SairaCondensed">But as tensions rise and factions clash, the island becomes a battleground of chaos and betrayal. The true power of the resource reveals itself, triggering a catastrophic event that changes everything. Now, with the region in ruin and alliances crumbling, survival becomes the ultimate mission.</p>
            <p className="font-SairaCondensed">Adapt, fight, and decide who to trust as the skies fall around you.</p>
            <p className="font-SairaCondensed text-xl">Welcome to Operation: Skyfall.</p>
